    <h1>Apartment life</h1>
    <p>Safe pod. What I love about this living pod.</p>
    <p>This space is clean and no smell and high ceilings and big windows with built in shades.
    I am not on the ground floor so feel safer, yet close enough to be able to view people passing
    by on the stairs. My corner unit has a lot of windows for a one bedroom, looking down on the parking 
    lot. That might not sound interesting but it really is. I get amused when a giant moving van passes
     by my window because I only see the very top and they remind me of ocean freighters passing
    by a condo window at the beach. There are giant moving vans here all the time, and it's exciting. I like
    seeing people changing their lives in a way that is similar to watching travellers in an airport. This
    is a dynamic environment. I think no one stays very long. That together with the walking distance to 
    all the retail and food and bar places, makes this place have a long-term hotel feel. There are also 
    a lot of actual hotels very nearby. The train and buses throw on an urban freedom feeling. This place
    is ten thousand times better than any of the other putrid rental situations I looked at. Saturday
    I should go to Top Golf for a golfing lesson, in the morning.

        I think this place is better defined, though, by what it is not. It is not mine. I don't have to 
        fix it, paint it, maintain it, worry about it. I have to clean it but it is SO MUCH SMALLER that 
        cleaning is a tiny effort. No mf stairs to have to wipe every day. How did they collect so much
        crap so quickly? Only one toilet. No yard. Even a little yard needed some occasional big effort. 
        Wish I had freed myself sooner. There are no animals in the walls. O how I hated the attic. But it 
        was my responsibility. O how I hated the crawlspace. I hated how the place shook when the washing 
        got to the spin cycle. (Turns out I like tub washers more than I thought. Way easier to add an
        item after the load is started!)  I also don't have to go through a major massive effort when
        leaving; no realtor or showing or inspection. I've been part of selling houses before and 
        don't recall it being this traumatic. I guess I've changed... I think I'm more aware of what
        can go wrong. I know when I was younger I just drifted through things and guess I was lucky
        it all worked out ok? Or do I just not remember the worry then? Anyway, I worry a lot now and 
        glad to not have to deal with selling a house anytime soon or probably ever.
