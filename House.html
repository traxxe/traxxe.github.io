    <h1>Apartment life</h1>
    <p>Safe pod. What I love about this living pod.</p>
    <p>This space is clean and no smell and high ceilings and big windows with built in shades.
    I am not on the ground floor so feel safer, yet close enough to be able to view people passing
    by on the stairs. My corner unit has a lot of windows for a one bedroom, looking down on the parking 
    lot. That might not sound interesting but it really is. I get amused when a giant moving van passes
     by my window because I only see the very top and they remind me of ocean freighters passing
    by a condo window at the beach. There are giant moving vans here all the time, and it's exciting. I like
    seeing people changing their lives in a way that is similar to watching travellers in an airport. This
    is a dynamic environment. I think no one stays very long. That together with the walking distance to 
    all the retail and food and bar places, makes this place have a long-term hotel feel. There are also 
    a lot of actual hotels very nearby. The train and buses throw on an urban freedom feeling. This place
    is ten thousand times better than any of the other putrid rental situations I looked at. Saturday
    I should go to Top Golf for a golfing lesson, in the morning.
