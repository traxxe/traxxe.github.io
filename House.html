    <h1>Apartment life</h1>
    <p>Safe pod. What I love about this living pod.</p>
    <p>This space is clean and no smell and high ceilings and big windows with built in shades.
    I am not on the ground floor so feel safer, yet close enough to be able to view people passing
    by to the stairs. My corner unit has a lot of windows for a one bedroom and I look at the parking 
    lot. That might not sound interesting but it really is. I get really amused when a giant moving van passes
     by my window because I only see the very top and they remind me of massive ocean freighters passing
    by a condo window down at the beach.
