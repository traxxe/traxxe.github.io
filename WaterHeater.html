    <h3>My old water heater needs to be replaced</h3>
    <div>
        It was installed in 2002. Works fine but I want to replace it now before there are issues.
    </div>
    <div>There is a water shutoff in the garage, and a water pressure reducer.</div>

    <div>The register under the door was added by an air conditioner guy about 5 years ago.<br/>I wonder if this means the water heater is incorrectly getting more inside air than it should be.</div>

    <div>The blue dotted line is where I think water should be directed in case of a leak.</div>
    <div>It would run outside and down the hill on the far side of the house.</div>
